# amazon-price-scrapping-using-python

Features:

Reliable Product Information Extraction:

Employs requests to establish secure connections and retrieve product data from Amazon.
Utilizes BeautifulSoup4 for efficient parsing of HTML content, extracting relevant details like title, price, and current date.
Data Storage and Tracking:
Leverages pandas to create a structured DataFrame, allowing for easy data manipulation and analysis.
Stores the scraped data in a CSV file (AmazonPriceStagScrapo.csv) for historical price tracking and further analysis.
Email Notifications (Optional):
Integrates datetime and smtplib (or a robust email library like yagmail) to send email alerts upon significant price changes or when a desired price threshold is reached.
Provides customizable price alert configuration (optional).
Modular and Reusable Code:
Employs well-defined functions for data scraping, data processing, and email notification (if applicable), enhancing readability and maintainability.
Uses descriptive variable names for clear code understanding.
Error Handling and Security Considerations:
Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential network issues and parsing errors.
Respects Amazon's terms of service by adhering to rate limits and avoiding excessive scraping requests.

Approach:
Project Setup:

Install required libraries: pandas, requests, bs4, datetime (and optionally smtplib or yagmail).
Define the target product URL and desired price scraping frequency.
Data Scraping:
Utilize requests to fetch the product page HTML content.
Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup4 to extract the product title, current price, and scrape date.

Data Processing:

Create a Pandas DataFrame to store the extracted product information.
Optionally, clean and pre-process the data (e.g., remove currency symbols from prices).
Append the current data to the existing CSV file (product_prices.csv).
Email Notifications (Optional):
Implement logic to compare the current price with a predefined threshold or historical prices (if data exists).
If a price change meets the notification criteria, utilize datetime to get the current date and smtplib (or yagmail) to send an email alert containing the product details and updated price.


Benefits:

Automated Price Tracking:
Eliminates manual product price checking, saving time and effort.
Provides a convenient way to monitor price fluctuations over time.
Price Alerts:
Helps you seize buying opportunities when prices reach a desired level (optional).
Ensures you stay informed about price changes without constantly checking the product page.
Enhanced Data Analysis:
Creates a dataset suitable for further analysis and visualization using tools like Pandas and Matplotlib.
Enables you to track price trends, identify price patterns, and make data-driven decisions.
